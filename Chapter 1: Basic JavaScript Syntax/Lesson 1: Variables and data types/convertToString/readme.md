1. Parameters of the function `convertToString`:

   - The function `convertToString` takes a single parameter `a`, which can be of various types based on the provided test cases:
     - `a` can be a number (integer or float) which needs to be converted to its string representation.
     - `a` can be a boolean (`true` or `false`) which should be converted to the strings `"true"` or `"false"`.
     - `a` can be `null` or `undefined`, which should be converted to the strings `"null"` and `"undefined"`, respectively.
     - `a` can also be a string, in which case the function should return the same string without modification.

2. Expected return value:

   - The function `convertToString` should return a string representation of the input `a` based on its type as described:
     - For numbers, convert them to their string representation.
     - For booleans, convert `true` to `"true"` and `false` to `"false"`.
     - For `null`, return `"null"`.
     - For `undefined`, return `"undefined"`.
     - For strings, return the same string.

3. Necessary concepts needed to finish the code block:
   - Type checking and conversion: Utilize JavaScript's built-in methods like `toString()` for numbers and string concatenation for booleans, null, and undefined.
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`): Use conditionals to determine the type of `a` and return the appropriate string representation.
   - Edge cases: Consider scenarios like `null`, `undefined`, and strings, ensuring they are handled correctly without unintended side effects.
   - JavaScript's type coercion: Understand how JavaScript handles type conversion implicitly, especially for boolean values and string operations.
