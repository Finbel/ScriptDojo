1. The `subtractNumbers` function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numeric values (integers or floating-point numbers). Based on the provided test cases:

   - `a` and `b` can be positive integers, negative integers, or zero.

2. The expected return value of the function `subtractNumbers` is the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, i.e., `a - b`.

3. To implement the `subtractNumbers` function:
   - **Subtraction Operation**: Use the `-` operator in JavaScript to perform the subtraction operation.
   - **Understanding Negative Numbers**: Ensure that the function correctly handles scenarios where both numbers are positive, both are negative, or one is positive and the other is negative.
   - **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as subtracting zero from a number, subtracting a number from itself, or subtracting from zero.
