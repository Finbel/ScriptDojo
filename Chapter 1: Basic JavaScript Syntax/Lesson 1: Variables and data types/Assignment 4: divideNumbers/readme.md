1. Explanation of parameters of the function `divideNumbers`:

- `a` and `b` are the parameters of the function `divideNumbers`.
- They are expected to be numeric values (integers or floating-point numbers) since division is defined for numerical operations.
- Special cases include `b` being 0, which should result in `Infinity` except for `0 / 0`, which should return `NaN`.

2. Explanation of the expected return value:

- The function `divideNumbers` should return the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
- If `b` is 0 and `a` is not 0, the function should return `Infinity`.
- If both `a` and `b` are 0, the function should return `NaN` to reflect indeterminate form.

3. Explanation of necessary concepts needed to finish the code block:

- **Division Operation**: Use the `/` operator for division in JavaScript.
- **Handling Zero Division**: Implement conditional checks to handle the case where `b` is 0 separately to avoid division by zero errors.
- **Type Checking**: Validate inputs to ensure `a` and `b` are numeric using JavaScript's `typeof` or `Number.isFinite()` if necessary.
- **Special Values**: Understand and implement handling for special cases like division by zero and edge cases involving `NaN`.
