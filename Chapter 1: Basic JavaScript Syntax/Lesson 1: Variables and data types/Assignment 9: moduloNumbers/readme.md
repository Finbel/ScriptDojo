1. **Parameters of the function `moduloNumbers`**:

   - The function `moduloNumbers` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. These parameters are expected to be numeric values (integers or floating-point numbers) because the function is designed to calculate the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`.

2. **Expected return value**:

   - The function `moduloNumbers` should return the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` (`a % b`).

3. **Necessary concepts needed to finish the code block**:

   - **Modulo Operation**: Utilize the `%` operator in JavaScript, which returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand.
   - **Handling Zero Division**: Ensure to handle the case where `b` is 0, which should result in returning `NaN`.
   - **Type Checking**: Implement checks to verify that `a` and `b` are numeric types before performing the modulo operation. JavaScript's `isNaN()` function can be useful for this purpose.
   - **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as when `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, where the result should be 0, or when non-numeric values are passed as parameters, which should also return `NaN` as per the test cases provided.
